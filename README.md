# webhook-websockets

This builds on [app-store-distributed-hooks](https://github.com/oliviaruizknott/app-store-distributed-hooks), but allows data to be added to the distributed app store through an HTTP API endpoint.

## Installation

Clone the repo, navigate into it, and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/oliviaruizknott/webhook-websockets.git
cd webhook-websockets
npm install
```

### Set your environment variables:

Make a copy of `.env.sample` and name it `.env`. Replace the variables in `.env` with your own local IP address and desired ports:

```
VITE_IP_ADDRESS=<your_ip_address>
VITE_WS_PORT=8082
HTTP_PORT=3000
```

If no variables are set, `VITE_IP_ADDRESS` will default to `localhost`, the `VITE_WS_PORT` will default to `8082`, and the `HTTP_PORT` will default to `3000`. The app will work on the device where you run it, but you wonâ€™t be able to connect with other devices.

### Start the servers

First, start the websocket and web servers. In the root of the project, run:

```
node index.js
```

In another terminal window, start the Vite server. In the root of the project, run:

```
npm run dev
```

Vite will output a link to open your project in browser, something like `http://localhost:5173`.

## Testing

### Basic Usage

Using some API-request sending software (I use the Thunder Client plugin for VS Code), send a POST request to the following url, where `YOUR.IP` is replaced with your local IP, and `3000` is replaced with your web server port, if different:

```
http://YOUR.IP:3000/webhook
```

The JSON that you send should appear in \_store.state, viewable under the `CUSTOM_JSON` key. (You should also see it in the debug panel, though at the time of this writing, the `CUSTOM_JSON` fields are not live-updating. ðŸ¤” You have to close and reopen the panel to see it.)

### Testing with NFC.cool

This repo was built initially to recieve data from an NFC.cool webhook. [NFC.cool](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-cool-tools-for-iphone/id1249686798?platform=iphone) is an iPhone app that can send scanned tag data to an API endpoint. The data from the tag looks like this:

```
{
  tagIdentifier: '04:89:73:8A:13:6F:80',
  date: '2023-10-17T20:36:04Z',
  content: 'custom data on the tag'
}
```

If you want to do the same test:

1. On an iPhone, download and set up [NFC.cool](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-cool-tools-for-iphone/id1249686798?platform=iphone). Warning: it costs ~$4/month! But there is a free trial.

2. In More > Webhook, enter the URL of your API. For local development and testing, youâ€™ll need to use something like [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local port 3000 to get it to replicate http://YOUR.IP:3000/webhook (or whatever your setup is). You can also use [beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/) for even quicker tests.

3. Prepare 3 NFC tags with the following text data:

```
e84855 // RED
f9dc5c // YELLOW
3185fc // BLUE
```

4. If your http + websocket server (`node server.js`) and web server (`npm run dev`) are running, and you are viewing the client website locally, scanning the NFC tags with the NFC.cool app should change the background color of the website.
